  Terraform Provider for Firewalla MSP
---

The Firewalla MSP provider is used to query the limited offerings provided by the Firewalla MSP API, most notably, the ability to maintain custom Target Lists. If you have a Firewalla box, note that Firewalla *does not* expose the API without a separate Firewalla MSP subscription, from which this provider leverages. 

The provider uses the [`firewalla-msp-go`](https://codeberg.org/joncoole/firewalla-msp-go) library
to interact with the [Firewalla MSP API](https://docs.firewalla.net).

Currently, this provider has been tested against Firewalla MSP version 2.9.1. Given that Firewalla has largely treated the API as something of an afterthought, support outside of the specific version number is unknown.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the valid data sources and resources.

This provider requires at least [Terraform 1.0](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
A minimum of Terraform 1.4.0 is recommended.
